# Python for non pythoners

This collection of notebooks and links to videos is oriented to people with low or non knowledge of python but wish to get some of its benefits without starting to program from zero.  
In that sense, this is an **application-oriented** "curriculum" .

## 1) Use python without installing python. Python in the cloud  

How to use python without installing python:   

+ Usage of google collaboratory  
	- Inspect a csv
	- Upload csv to google collaboratory
	- Make some changes to csv file
	- Download new csv
	- Connect google drive to google collaboratory and save in there

	- Lines with areas  
	- Heatmaps  

## 3) Customize Plots


## 4) Some programming for processing

## 5) Some advanced topic

## 6) Unknown... (Depends on the demand) Maybe Machine learning?
